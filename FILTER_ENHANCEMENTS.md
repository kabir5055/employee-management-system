3. **Error Messages**: Clear, user-friendly error messages returned to frontend
4. **Performance Limits**: Date range restrictions to maintain system performance

## Technical Features

### Frontend Enhancements
1. **State Management**: 
   - `isLoading` state for all filter operations
   - `filterErrors` state for error handling
   - Separate states for each filter field

2. **Validation Logic**:
   - Date range validation before API calls
   - Client-side validation with immediate feedback
   - Server-side validation as backup

3. **User Experience**:
   - Loading spinners during operations
   - Disabled controls during loading
   - Visual feedback for active filters

### Error Handling Strategy

2. **Network-Level**: Handles API call failures
3. **Server-Side**: Validates and handles backend errors
4. **User-Friendly**: All errors displayed in readable format

## Filter Usage Examples

### Single Field Filtering
- Search only: User can search employees by name only
- Date only: User can filter reports by start date only
- Category only: User can filter expenses by category only

### Multiple Field Filtering
- Any combination of fields can be used together
- Fields are additive (AND logic)
- Active filters clearly displayed to user

### Error Scenarios Handled
1. **Invalid Date Ranges**: Start date after end date
2. **Excessive Date Ranges**: Ranges too large for performance
3. **Network Errors**: API call failures
4. **Server Errors**: Backend processing errors

## Implementation Status
✅ **Employee Balances Report** - Complete with advanced features
✅ **Product Performance Report** - Complete with validation
✅ **Delivery Statistics Report** - Complete with error handling
✅ **Employee Management** - Complete with flexible filtering
✅ **Expense Management** - Complete with optional fields
